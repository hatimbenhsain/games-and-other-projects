# Escape

[Play the game on your browser](https://hatimbenhsain.github.io/escape/index.html)

A game about an angel who tries to break their friend out of prison. The game has different endings depending on the dialogue choices and what characters the player talks to. The controls are WASD keys to move and space bar to interact with objects or people.

I coded the game and made the sprites on GameMaker. The sounds come from freesound.org.
