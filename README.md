# Games And Other Projects:

A portfolio repository where I host some of the projects I worked on in the past.

The projects I am currently hosting here are:

1. Trial: a Unity 3D game made for my Games and Play class in 2018.

2. Loco: a Processing simulation where I try to replicate some of the physics in the game Locoroco using Box2D

3. UnBoxing: a small p5.js game made for my Games and Play class in 2018.
