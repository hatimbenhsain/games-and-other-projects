A game where you play as a spider. The first part of the game is a descent through a black and white environment as the spider hangs form a thread and the player has to push it to avoid obstacles. The second part is a walking simulator where 3 buttons control 3 pairs of legs and the player is challenged to make the spider walk - or at least not fall on its head. The game was presented as part of the Interactive Media final showcase in Fall 2019, in NYU Abu Dhabi.
