# Trial:

A game disrupting the digital and analog worlds, where cheating is a valid part of the play experience. Exploring verticality and playing with Unity. Final project for the class "Games and Play".

The game was presented as part of the final Interactive Media showcase in NYU Abu Dhabi Fall 2018. We used music from the Legend of Zelda series and assets from the Unity marketplace.

As part of the game's presentation, we installed a desk that simulated a child's room. On it, a desk lamp shines on a notebook that says "DO NOT OPEN". Inside of the notebook are cheat codes that can either enhance, facilitate, or hinder the play experience. Because we wanted the player to experiment and play around with the codes, we made the game particularly hard to beat. However, it is still open to win without using codes, which gives a different final outcome.
